# Pocket Pi

A [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev/) shipped as an Android APK. No Termux install, no shell setup — install the APK, paste an LLM key (or sign in to Claude Pro/Max), chat.

Pocket Pi is a thin Android wrapper around two upstream projects that do the real work:

- **[Pi coding agent](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent)** by [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner) — the underlying agent engine. The canonical home is now [earendil-works/pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent).
- **[pi-agent-dashboard](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-agent-dashboard)** by [BlackBelt Technology](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology) — the web chat UI rendered inside the APK's WebView (slash commands, session history, model switcher, provider settings, OAuth flows). [pi-anthropic-messages](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-anthropic-messages) (also BlackBelt) is the Anthropic protocol bridge that makes Claude Pro/Max OAuth tokens usable from Pi.

What Pocket Pi adds is the packaging: a Termux runtime, postinstall script, an Android service that supervises `pi --mode rpc` + the dashboard's Node server, a Compose WebView with a small recovery UI for when the bootstrap stalls, and an on-device HTTP bridge (`127.0.0.1:9998`, per-launch bearer token) that lets the agent reach Android capabilities — notifications, intents, share-sheet, camera, mic, location, clipboard, deep-link inbox — without any companion APK.

## Install

1. Grab the latest APK — **v0.4.0** — from the [Releases page](https://github.com/CelestialCreator/pocket-pi/releases/latest), or directly: [pocket-pi-v0.4.0.apk](https://github.com/CelestialCreator/pocket-pi/releases/download/v0.4.0/pocket-pi-v0.4.0.apk) (68 MB, aarch64 only).
2. Sideload — tap the APK on the phone (allow install from unknown sources for your browser/file manager), or `adb install pocket-pi-v0.4.0.apk`. **On Android 13+ devices, Play Protect will warn and Accessibility may be blocked — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.**
3. Open the app. First launch runs the bootstrap (3–5 min on Wi-Fi: extracts Termux, installs Node + npm packages, registers Pi extensions).
4. When the dashboard loads, tap its **⚙** (top-right of the page chrome) → **Providers** → add at least one provider. See [Providers — what works](#providers--what-works) below.
5. Pick a model, chat away.

If the dashboard never finishes binding, the loading screen surfaces **Restart Pi** and **Re-run setup** buttons after a 15-second stall — those re-kick the service and re-run the bootstrap installer respectively. As a last resort, force-stop the app from Android Settings and reopen; the install state on disk is preserved.

## Upload and download files

In the Folders view, tap **Files** beside the **Folder** button. This is shared web
UI: it works in desktop/mobile browsers and in the Android app, without a native
JavaScript bridge. Choose Pi home, a pinned folder, or a session's working directory
from the folder selector, then navigate into subfolders.

- **Upload** uses the browser's file picker (Android's document picker inside the
  app). Files up to **100 MiB** are streamed to the selected folder. Existing files
  are never overwritten; a name conflict is shown as an error.
- Tap a file to **download** it through your browser, or choose a save destination
  in Android's save dialog. Binary files are copied unchanged.
- **Up** navigates to the parent folder; **Refresh** reloads files created by Pi.

Transfers use the dashboard's existing access controls. Paths and symlink targets
must stay within the selected folder. No Android storage permission is needed.
Folder archives are not supported. See [integration and testing](docs/file-transfers.md)
for standalone web-dashboard installations.

## Providers — what works

The dashboard's Providers UI lists **two** sections: `SUBSCRIPTIONS (OAUTH)` and `API KEYS`. Not everything in the OAuth list works end-to-end on Pocket Pi today — the OAuth flow stores credentials, but actually *using* those credentials requires a Pi-side protocol bridge for each vendor. Only Anthropic's bridge is bundled.

| Provider | OAuth Sign-In | API Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** (Claude Pro/Max) | ✓ end-to-end | ✓ | OAuth uses your `claude.ai` subscription quota via the bundled [`pi-anthropic-messages`](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-anthropic-messages) bridge. Sign-In opens your phone's default browser via an `xdg-open` shim → Android `ACTION_VIEW`. |
| **OpenAI** | — | ✓ | API key from `platform.openai.com`. |
| **Google Gemini** (AI Studio key) | — | ✓ | API key from `aistudio.google.com/app/apikey`. Recommended path for Gemini on Pocket Pi. |
| **Google Gemini CLI** OAuth | partial — Sign-In completes but unusable | n/a | Requires `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` env var and a Pi-side `gemini-cli` bridge; neither is wired up. Use the AI Studio key instead. |
| **ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)** OAuth | Sign-In completes but unusable | — | Codex protocol bridge not bundled. |
| **GitHub Copilot** OAuth | Sign-In completes but unusable | — | Copilot protocol bridge not bundled. |
| **Antigravity** OAuth | Sign-In completes but no models | — | No model catalog without a bridge. |
| **Groq** | — | ✓ | API key from `console.groq.com`. |
| **Mistral / xAI / Z.ai / OpenRouter / NVIDIA NIM** | — | ✓ | All use standard API-key paste. |

If you want to use Claude Pro/Max OAuth on Pocket Pi but prefer signing in on a different device, the manual flow works too: grab the auth URL the dashboard would have opened, sign in on your laptop browser, copy the `http://localhost:53692/callback?…` redirect URL out of the laptop's address bar, and open it in your phone's Chrome — the phone's Chrome will hit Pocket Pi's on-device callback server and finish the exchange.

## What's inside

| Layer | Component | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| App shell | Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose) — `android/` | Pocket Pi |
| Linux runtime | Termux bootstrap (Node 25, Python, git, ripgrep, openssl) — `bootstrap/` | [Termux](https://termux.dev/) |
| Chat UI | [`@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blackbelt-technology/pi-agent-dashboard) — binds `:8000` (browser UI) + `:9999` (pi extension bridge); rendered in the app WebView. Slash commands, model switching, session history, provider settings, OAuth. | [BlackBelt Technology](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-agent-dashboard) |
| Agent engine | [`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent), spawned as `pi --mode rpc` | [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) / [earendil-works](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) |
| Pi extensions | [`pi-anthropic-messages`](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology/pi-anthropic-messages) (Claude Pro/Max OAuth + tool-call rendering) + `pi-web-access`, `pi-subagents`, `oh-pi`, `@aliou/pi-guardrails`, `pi-mcp-adapter`, `pk-pi-hermes-evolve`, **`pi-termux-tools`** (Pocket Pi's phone-surface tools — notifications, intents, camera, mic, location, inbox) | various (see `bootstrap/npm-packages.txt`) + `extensions/pi-termux-tools/` |
| Compose-side UI | Loading / recovery pane only (Pocket Pi splash, postinstall log tail, inline `Restart Pi` + `Re-run setup` buttons after a 15s stall). Everything else lives in the dashboard's own settings UI. | Pocket Pi |
| Native bridges | **Localhost HTTP API** on `127.0.0.1:9998` (bearer token at `$PREFIX/etc/pocket-pi/api-token`, mode 0600, rotated per service start) exposing notify / share / intent / clipboard / battery / location / camera/photo / mic/record / inbox to the agent. `xdg-open` shim (postinstall) → Android `ACTION_VIEW`. Compose-side `PocketPi.notify/share/openExternal/toast` JS interface for the WebView. Share-target + `pi://agent/…` deep-link intent-filters queue payloads into `$HOME/.pi/agent/inbox/`. | Pocket Pi |

## Build from source

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap zip (produces bootstrap/dist/bootstrap-aarch64.zip, ~30M)
cd bootstrap && ./build-bootstrap.sh aarch64

# 2. (Optional) the custom Pi extensions
cd ../extensions/pi-termux-tools && pnpm install && pnpm build
cd ../pi-skill-learner       && pnpm install && pnpm build

# 3. APK
cd ../../android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk (~40 MB)
```

Shared file-transfer tests: `cd bootstrap/patches/dashboard-files && npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm test`.
Android tests: `cd android && ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`.
For browser/device checks, see [the file-transfer checklist](docs/file-transfers.md).

The current build uses `applicationId = com.termux` so the upstream Termux bootstrap binaries (which bake in the path `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr`) work without recompiling. To ship under a real app id, run `bootstrap/rebuild-with-prefix.sh` (Docker, 4–12 h on Apple Silicon) to produce a bootstrap pinned to a custom prefix, then flip `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.

## What works / what doesn't (v0.4.0)

| | Status |
|---|---|
| Single-APK install on aarch64 phones | ✓ |
| pi-agent-dashboard as the WebView UI (slash commands, model switcher, session history all native) | ✓ |
| API-key chat for OpenAI / Anthropic API / Google Gemini (AI Studio) / Groq / Mistral / xAI / NVIDIA NIM / OpenRouter (tool use, cost tracking) | ✓ |
| Claude Pro/Max **OAuth** Sign-In → device default browser → on-device callback | ✓ |
| **Phone-surface tools for the agent** (notifications, share sheet, generic Android intents, dial, settings deep-links, clipboard, battery) | ✓ — new in v0.3.0 |
| **Location** (fused gps/network, foreground only) | ✓ — new in v0.3.0 |
| **Camera** (one-shot still capture, front/back) | ✓ — new in v0.3.0 |
| **Microphone** (record N seconds to AAC/.m4a) | ✓ — new in v0.3.0 |
| **Incoming intents** — "Share to Pocket Pi" target, `pi://agent/…` deep links, queued for the agent | ✓ — new in v0.3.0 |
| **`pocket-pi-api` shell shim** — `pocket-pi-api notify '{…}'`, `pocket-pi-api camera/photo '{…}'` etc. from any Termux session | ✓ — new in v0.3.0 |
| Recovery UI when the dashboard doesn't bind within 15s (inline Restart Pi / Re-run setup buttons) | ✓ |
| Other OAuth providers (Gemini CLI, ChatGPT Codex, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity) | sign-in completes but no models — Pi-side protocol bridges not bundled. Use the API-key path instead. |
| Shell-session feature inside the dashboard | not yet — `node-pty` has no android-arm64 prebuild and is stubbed; chat/files/tasks work, terminal tab will fail |
| **Mobile UI automation** (the agent reading other apps' screens, dispatching taps/swipes/text input/gestures, polling notifications + window-change events) | ✓ — new in v0.4.0. AccessibilityService vendored from [KarryViber/orb-eye](https://github.com/KarryViber/orb-eye) (MIT). One-time manual toggle in Settings → Accessibility → Pocket Pi (Android forbids runtime enablement). |
| **Baked-in `pocket-pi-android-control` skill** so sub-Opus models actually reach for the new tools — fallback chain (deep link → intent → launch by package + UI drive → verify), six worked examples (Clock timer, WhatsApp, Dark theme, Contacts, notification reactor, read-screen), anti-patterns, deep-link catalog. Drops into `~/.pi/agent/skills/` at first launch. | ✓ — new in v0.4.0 |
| Background location ("Allow all the time") | not yet — foreground only this release. Add the Settings escalation when a real use case appears. |
| `applicationId` ≠ `com.termux` | not yet — requires custom bootstrap rebuild |
| Old Android WebView builds (Chrome < ~120) | emulator system images ship stale WebView; real devices auto-update — confirmed working in Chrome 140+ |

## Troubleshooting

Two install-time gotchas on real Android 12+ devices that don't appear on the emulator. Both have one-time fixes.

### "Play Protect blocks the install"

When you tap the APK, Android's Play Protect scanner throws a scary "harmful app" warning and the install dialog defaults to **Cancel**. Pocket Pi isn't malicious — Play Protect just doesn't recognise it because it's not on the Play Store. Two recovery paths:

- **Easiest:** on the install dialog itself, tap **More details** → **Install anyway** (or **Install without scanning**). Doesn't change any system setting.
- **Or:** Settings → Google → Play Protect (gear icon, top right) → toggle **Scan apps with Play Protect** off → install → toggle it back on. Play Protect re-scans periodically; once Pocket Pi is installed, it stays trusted.

The signal is correct in spirit — Pocket Pi isn't on the Play Store. The APK source is the [Releases page on this repo](https://github.com/CelestialCreator/pocket-pi/releases/latest), so it's your own choice to trust it. Pocket Pi has no telemetry, no analytics, and no network calls of its own — everything that goes out is from your chosen LLM provider's SDK and the Pi agent runtime ([see Credits](#credits)).

### "Accessibility toggle is greyed out (Restricted settings)"

After tapping **Use Pocket Pi** in Settings → Accessibility, the toggle visibly does nothing. This is Android 13+'s "Restricted settings" mitigation, which blocks Accessibility for any APK not installed via Play Store — Pocket Pi included. The unlock is hidden but two taps away:

1. Settings → Apps → **Pocket Pi**
2. Tap the **⋮ menu** in the top-right corner of the App info screen *(on OxygenOS, MIUI, OneUI: scroll all the way to the bottom of App info instead — the same option lives there)*
3. Tap **Allow restricted settings** → confirm
4. Go back to Settings → Accessibility → **Pocket Pi** → toggle **Use Pocket Pi** — it now binds. Accept the system consent dialog ("Allow Pocket Pi to have full control of your device").

This affects every legitimate Accessibility consumer that's sideloaded — Tasker, Bitwarden autofill, KDE Connect all hit the same wall. v0.5's planned custom-prefix bootstrap unlocks the Play Store distribution path, which removes this step permanently.

## Credits

Pocket Pi is just packaging. The actual agent engine and the chat UI are someone else's work — Pocket Pi wouldn't exist without:

- **Pi coding agent** — [Mario Zechner](https://github.com/mariozechner) (original author) and the [earendil-works](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) maintainers. The runtime that powers every chat turn, tool call, and skill in this app. See [pi.dev](https://pi.dev/).
- **pi-agent-dashboard** + **pi-anthropic-messages** — [BlackBelt Technology](https://github.com/BlackBeltTechnology). The web chat UI rendered inside the APK's WebView, plus the Anthropic protocol bridge that makes Claude Pro/Max OAuth work end-to-end.
- **Termux** — the Termux maintainers. The Linux-on-Android runtime that lets us ship Node, Python, and the rest inside a single APK without root or a custom ROM.
- **orb-eye** — [KarryViber](https://github.com/KarryViber/orb-eye). The AccessibilityService that powers v0.4's UI-automation surface; vendored under MIT with attribution preserved in the source header.

Pi extension ecosystem authors are credited individually in each package's `package.json`; see `bootstrap/npm-packages.txt` for the install list.

## License

MIT for Pocket Pi's own source. Third-party runtime components keep their own licenses (Termux GPL, Pi MIT, pi-agent-dashboard's license, etc.) — see each upstream repo for details, and `LICENSE` for the Pocket Pi terms.

## Status

**v0.4.0 — agent has the phone and the screen.** Daily-drivable. On top of the v0.3 phone surface (notifications, intents both directions, share-sheet, camera, mic, location, clipboard, deep-link inbox), v0.4 adds a full UI-automation surface via a vendored [KarryViber/orb-eye](https://github.com/KarryViber/orb-eye) AccessibilityService: the agent can read any app's element tree, find by text/desc/id, dispatch taps / swipes / long-presses / scrolls / multi-finger gestures, set text on focused fields, take screenshots (API 30+), fire global actions (back/home/recents/notifications), buffer system notifications, and long-poll a window-change + notification event channel for proactive behaviour. All gated by the same per-launch bearer token over localhost. No companion APK, no root, no shell setup; one manual Accessibility toggle in Settings on first run (Android requirement — Pocket Pi deep-links there from its onboarding pane).

Bundled alongside the tools is a **baked-in `pocket-pi-android-control` skill** at `~/.pi/agent/skills/pocket-pi-android-control/SKILL.md`. Shipping the tools alone wasn't enough — emulator testing showed sub-Opus models (qwen-flash, etc.) would call `pocket_pi_intent_send` once, hit a wall, and give up. The skill anchors the fallback chain (deep link → generic intent → launch by package + UI drive → verify) with six worked examples and anti-patterns. With it loaded, the same models that bailed without it now complete full chains end-to-end.

Roadmap from here, in rough priority order:

- **v0.5 — working shell-session tab** in the dashboard once a viable `node-pty` android-arm64 prebuild exists (currently stubbed; terminal tab is the last dashboard feature without backing).
- **Background location escalation** when a real use case lands ("Allow all the time" → `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`).
- **More OAuth providers** end-to-end (Gemini CLI, ChatGPT Codex, GitHub Copilot, Antigravity) — each requires a small Pi-side protocol bridge analogous to `pi-anthropic-messages`.
- **Custom-prefix bootstrap** so `applicationId` can move off `com.termux`. Currently a 4–12 h Docker build on Apple Silicon; once it's clean, the path to a real signed release on Play Store is short.
