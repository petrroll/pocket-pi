# build natively, and gets SIGKILLed by Android — leaving the dashboard
# stuck on "Installing pi… sessions will be available shortly".
#
# Pointing tool-overrides.json at our existing pi binary + cli.js makes the
# resolver short-circuit through `overrideStrategy` and skip the install
# entirely. Idempotent: this is the source of truth, we always overwrite.

# shows as "not found" in Settings → Tools even when it's right there in
# $PREFIX/bin. Adding explicit overrides flips those rows from ✗ to ✓ and
# lets dashboard features that lean on these binaries (git status display,
# process inspection in shell sessions, etc.) actually work.
#
# pi + pi-coding-agent serve a different purpose here: their overrides

# itself uses to dispatch http(s) URLs to the default browser app.
